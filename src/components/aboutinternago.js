                    <p><span className="aboutfirstword">Internago</span> was founded with the objective to reduce administrative work and make your international business simple with increased control by digitalization.
                   <br /> <br />After working for many years handling the complexity that comes with international business, and running payroll services on foreign markets, we realized that a digital payroll portal to streamline the payroll was needed to make life easier for our customers.  </p>

                    <p><span className="aboutfirstword">We believe</span> that payroll outsourcing can be simple and cost efficient through digitalization. <br /> <br />
                    This is why we developed the Internago Payroll Portal, which enables our customers to save time and keep control over their payroll on many markets from one digital interface.
                    <br /> <br />Working with Internago also means that you have one dedicated project manager that follows your business from the start and as it develops over time.
                    <br /> <br />Quality is also very important to us and where we donâ€™t deliver through our own payroll, we collaborate with the best and carefully selected local partners to ensure that our customers follow all local regulations. </p>
